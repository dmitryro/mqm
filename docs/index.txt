Setup a project for development
-------------------------------

There are a few simple steps you need to follow to setup this project:

1. Checkout the source code
2. Make sure your python is installed correctly (see :doc:`install python
<install_python>`)
3. Run::

    fab devinit

``fab devinit``
---------------

After you have created a new checkout go to the directory and run::

    fab devinit

This will run a couple of things for you:

* It will set up a virtualenv for you
* It installs all the python dependecies into the virtualenv
* It creates a ``local_settings.py`` file if non exists yet
* It installes a sqlite db ready to use and runs ``syncdb``
* It creates a superuser for the project called *admin* with password
  *admin*.

Working on a project
--------------------

Djangos management command can be found at the root of the project. Run
commands like this::

    python manage.py runserver
