Skeleton Project Documentation
==============================

``fab devinit``
---------------

After you have created a new checkout go to the directory and run::

    fab devinit

This will run a couple of things for you:

    * It will set up buildout environment (``python bootstrap.py`` and
      ``bin/buildout``)
    * It creates a ``local_settings.py`` file for you.
    * It installes a sqlite db ready to use and runs ``syncdb``.
    * It creates a superuser for the project called *admin* with password
      *admin*.

``restartfcgi``
---------------

*restartfcgi* is the same as e.g. ``./bac`` or ``./hoxton`` with other
projects. Its a script to restart the django FCGI server. Run the following
while you are in the root directory of the project on the server to restart
the site::

* If for any reason you get permission denied when trying to use 'restartfcgi'
run: chmod +x restartfcgi

    ./restartfcgi

nginx config
------------

There is a file called ``nginx.conf`` in the ``config/`` directory. Use this
to configure nginx. After you customized ``nginx.conf``, commit and update the
server. Now run the following command to make the configuration file available
to nginx::

    ln -s /home/alice/config/nginx.conf /opt/nginx/conf.d/alice.conf

You can now restart nginx to make the site online. If you want to "uninstall"
the site (to take it offline), just remove the symbolic link you created with
the ``ln`` command::

    rm /opt/nginx/conf.d/alice.conf

Restart nginx and the site will be offline.
