Install python on MacOS
=======================

This is what we currently do with new macs:

* Install _`macports <install macports>`
* Make sure macports is installed :)
* Install python using macports::

    sudo port selfupdate
    sudo port python27

* Make sure that you use the correct python version::

    which python

Should return something like this starting with ``/opt/``::

    /opt/local/bin/python

.. _install macports: http://www.macports.org/install.php

Install PIL (Python Imaging Library)
------------------------------------

* Install PIL using macports::

    sudo port install py27-pil

* Test if it installed correctly::

    python
    >>> import PIL
    >>> import Image

This should not give you any errors.
