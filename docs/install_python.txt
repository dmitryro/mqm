Install python on MacOS
=======================

This is what we currently do with new macs:

* Install _`macports <install macports>`
* Make sure macports is installed :)
* Install python using macports::

    sudo port selfupdate
    sudo port install python27
    sudo port select --set python python27
    sudo port install py-setuptools
    sudo port install py-pip
    sudo port install py-virtualenv
    sudo port install py-fabric

* Make sure that you use the correct python version::

    which python

Should return something like this starting with ``/opt/``::

    /opt/local/bin/python

.. _install macports: http://www.macports.org/install.php

If all of the above was successfull, then run::

    sudo mv /usr/bin/python /usr/bin/python_original
    sudo ln -s /usr/bin/python `which python`

This will overwrite the systems python version with the one we just installed
via macports.

Install PIL (Python Imaging Library)
------------------------------------

* Install PIL using macports::

    sudo port install py27-pil

* Test if it installed correctly::

    python
    >>> import PIL
    >>> import Image

This should not give you any errors.

Install required python libraries
---------------------------------

If you are on a Mac, the commands at the beginning of the page already did
this for you. On all other platforms, run::

    sudo easy_install pip
    sudo pip install virtualenv
    sudo pip install fabric
